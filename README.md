# RacingGameWithSave
The game starts with the user entering the total number of tiles on the race track. Each tile represents one position in one dimension. A tile can be of type Snake, Vulture, Cricket, White, or Trampoline . This is a single player game and once the game starts, its the computer who plays the game without any user intervention, and continues playing until the player wins. For this must use I/O Streams, Serialization, Deserialization, and JUnit Testing.
